# Micrombat
## Jogo desenvolvido 100% em Python.
 
---Several viruses and bacteria are invading and trying to take control by spreading their infections across the body. The rest of the white blood cells have fallen already, but you have a secret weapon at your disposal... the Biolazer gun!---



The enemies are spawning from the infections. You have three lives and you lose one whenever an enemy gets in contact with you, but you can recover it by stunning enemies with your biolazer gun and phagocytizing the enemy (Eating it alive!).

The infections (purple dots on the minimap) will continue to spawn as enemies spread a chemical gas around the map (yellow dots). You can put out these chemicals before they turn into new infections.

### Para jogar:
